Catch that *** in 4k

## What is ci4k?
You ever have one of those really annoying pop-up cmd windows and don't feel like starting the event log in Windows just to figure out what it is? That's what spawned this little app. Caught in 4k lets you catch what happened on your screen in whatever resolution your screens at. *Not actually 4k unless you have a 4k display*.

## Requirements
* Windows 10
